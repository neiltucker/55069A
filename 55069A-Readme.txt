This course uses two setup guides.  55069A-ENU_PowerShellSetup_hv2.pdf for setup on Windows Server 2008 or 55069A-ENU_PowerShellSetup_hv3.pdf for setup on later operating systems that support Hyper-V.

Customized deliveries of 55069A are possible in combination with other PowerShell & SQL Server classes.  

For additional help in configuring such deliveries or choosing the right setup strategy, please read the Trainer Preparation Guide (55069A-ENU_TrainerPreparationandNotes.pdf) or contact the author (neil@neiltucker.biz).



*****   PLEASE READ BEFORE PERFORMING SETUP   *****
Feedback from trainers and students indicate that many students prefer to focus on modules 2 and 3 (administration & maintenance) instead of module 1 (Installation).  It is therefore recommended that unless the students indicate otherwise, the labs for module 1 should be skipped to focus on the exercises in modules 2 and 3.  The optional lab exercises in modules 2 and 3 will provide more than enough material to replace the labs in module 1.  If individual students want to perform the exercises in lab 1, they may use the interactive lab simulations to do the exercises.  

To automatically configure the components installed in lab 1 and to prepare for lab 2, execute run3.cmd from the A:\ drive of each virtual machine.  Further information on customizing the VMs can be found in the PowerShell setup guide.


Licensing:
The training center or any organization hosting the lab computers for this class are fully responsible for the licensing of all software used in the course and labs. 
An Azure deployment of the class may make this process easier.

Updates:
Updates to class files can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/neiltucker/55069A).
